# Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights – Tata iQ (Forage)

This project is part of a virtual job simulation offered by **Tata Insights & Quants (Tata iQ)** via [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), focused on real-world business data analysis and visualization.

I completed this simulation to gain practical experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights using **Tableau and Excel**, while tailoring visual reports and insights to suit executive decision-making needs.

> Dashboards were created in **Tableau** with each question represented on a separate tab and exported in `.twbx` format.
